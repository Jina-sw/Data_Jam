# Tech Stacks
NumPy, Pandas, Jupiter Notebook
## Goals
- We predict which player out of 9 would win in the next game, using supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Find the most proper AI model for the given data sets.
- Train the AI model with the given data.
- Increase the accuracy of the results from the chosen model.
- Modify and optimize the data set for better estimations.
- Freely use ChatGPT or other AI tools. 

## My Approach
- Even though I didn't have any knowledge or backgrounds, I tried hard to understand what the data sets meant, keeping the goal of this data jam in mind.
- I searched tons of information about AI models on Google and ChatGPT
- I realized choosing an AI model is important and each model is better in a certain data set for higher accuracy
- I picked the "Linear Regression" model which is known for predicting a continuous outcome (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices, or temperature)
- Worked well.
- Tested other models to see the actual results of the prediction.
- Also the number showed that the "Linear Regression" model worked the best.
- I won the second place out of 10 participants!
